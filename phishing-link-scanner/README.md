# Phishing Link Scanner

This command-line tool detects potential phishing links by analyzing URLs for suspicious patterns and characteristics. It's built for educational purposes as part of a cybersecurity portfolio.

## Features

- Multi-factor analysis of URLs to detect potential phishing attempts
- Detection of non-secure HTTP protocols
- Identification of suspicious domain names and patterns
- Recognition of URL shorteners that may hide malicious destinations
- Detection of homoglyphs and special character manipulation
- Reporting with detailed explanations for each suspicious element
- Customizable sensitivity settings

## Installation

### Prerequisites

  --url URL, -u URL     URL to scan
  --verbose, -v         Show detailed analysis
  --threshold THRESHOLD, -t THRESHOLD
                        Suspicion threshold (0-100, default: 70)
  --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
                        Output results to file
```

### Example Output

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
üîç PHISHING LINK SCANNER RESULTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
URL: http://facebo0k.com/login.php?secur1ty=verification-needed
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚ùå SUSPICIOUS [80/100]: This URL contains multiple phishing indicators

ANALYSIS:
‚úì Uses non-secure HTTP protocol
‚úì Domain contains homoglyphs (0 instead of o)
‚úì URL contains security-baiting terms
‚úì Unusual characters in domain name
‚úì PHP script handling login information
‚úì URL parameter suggests urgent action

RECOMMENDATION:
This URL exhibits classic phishing characteristics. Avoid clicking or 
entering any personal information. The domain attempts to mimic Facebook
but contains character substitutions.

## Technical Details

The scanner evaluates URLs based on several factors:

1. **Protocol Analysis**
   - HTTP instead of HTTPS
   - Protocol obfuscation

2. **Domain Analysis**
   - Similarity to popular domains (typosquatting)
   - Homoglyph detection (similar-looking characters)
   - Excessive subdomains
   - Recently registered domains

3. **Path and Parameter Analysis**
   - Presence of security-baiting terms
   - Suspicious file extensions
   - Unusual URL parameters
   - Redirection indicators

4. **Content Assessment**
   - URL shortener detection
   - IP address instead of domain name
   - Special character misuse (@, //, etc.)

## Security Scoring

Each detected issue contributes to an overall suspicion score:

- 0-30: Low risk
- 31-60: Medium risk
- 61-80: High risk
- 81-100: Very high risk

## Code Structure

- `scanner.py` - Main script with CLI interface
- `core/` - Directory containing core functionality:
  - `analyzer.py` - URL analysis engine
  - `rules.py` - Phishing detection rules
  - `reporter.py` - Reporting functions
- `utils/` - Utility functions and helpers:

  - `homoglyphs.py` - Homoglyph detection

## Limitations

- This tool provides an indication of risk but is not 100% accurate
- False positives may occur with legitimate but unusual URLs
- False negatives may occur with sophisticated phishing techniques
- No webpage content analysis is performed

## Educational Use

This tool is designed for educational purposes to:

- Understand how phishing URLs are constructed
